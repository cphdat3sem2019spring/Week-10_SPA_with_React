## Thuersday - Recap on Threads, Futures, Callables and  Asynchronous Rest with Jax-rs,
_Today we will recap on thread programming as you were introduced to last semester. More specifically we will introduce Callables and Futures in combination with Jax-rs's Asynchronous Server API.

## Business competences

Demands for skills related to JavaScript and Single Page Applications has increased over the last years 
- [ref. it.jobindex.dk - JavaScript](https://it.jobindex.dk/jobsoegning?q=javascript&supid=1).
- [ref. it.jobindex.dk - React]( https://it.jobindex.dk/jobsoegning/it?q=react).

JavaScript, and React this semester, will provide students with the background to join modern front-end teams, using JS and supplementing JS frameworks like React
